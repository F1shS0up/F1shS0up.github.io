		<h1>What even is rigid body?</h1>
		<p>
			A rigid body is a perfect representation of a body that does not deform or change shape. While this is
			imposible in real world it looks good enough for games and it has better performance.
		</p>
		<h1 id="newton-laws">Three Laws of Motion:</h1>
		<ol type="1">
			<li><b>Inertia</b> - An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at
				constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force.</li>
			<li><b>Force</b> - The acceleration of an object depends on the mass of the object and the amount of force
				applied. This can be written as <b>acceleration = force / mass</b></li>
			<li><b>Action and Reactioin</b> - Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the second object
				exerts an equal and opposite force on the first.</li>
		</ol>
		<h1>Order of events</h1>
		<img src="images/rigidbody-order.png" alt="" class="roundcorners extra-small floatR">
		<p>
			The order of actions after setting them up is as follows:
		<ol type="1">
			<li><b>Apply forces</b> - Simply apply vectors by adding them to force vector which is reseted every frame
			</li>
			<li><b>Update velocities and then positions</b> - Implicit(Backwards) euler, numerical integration that
				first adds force to linear and angular velocity and then it changes position and rotation</li>
			<li><b>Detect and resolve collision</b></li>
			<li><b>Solve constrains(Not covered in these blogs yet)</b></li>
			<li><b>Display results</b></li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			This will also be the order I will go through this... In this blog I just talk about setting up the bodies.
		</p>
		<h1>Basics of rigid bodies</h1>
		<p>
			So lets say we have a rigidbody component which will hold most of the variables.
			<br><b>What are the variables it will keep?</b>
			<br>There are <b>two main</b> variables which will be defined on set up: <b>Mass and moment of inertia</b>.
			Mass is self explanatory and moment of inertia defines how much force needs to be applied to rotate rigid
			body.
			We will also have <b>inverse mass and inverse moment of inertia</b> which is just 1/mass and 1/inertia.
			There will ofcourse be some other variables like <b>angular drag or linear drag</b> but I will talk about
			that later.
			<br>After that we need something to hold our variables that <b>are changed every frame</b>. This will
			include <b>force, linear velocity, torque and angular velocity</b>. Force and torque(in nutshell force for
			rotation) are recalculated every frame.
			As for both velocities there are just changed during frame.
			<br>Obviously we can't forget <b>position and rotation</b>. I would advise not keeping them in rigidbody
			because usually the simulation won't be for rigidbodies only and position and rotation(I like it in radians
			instead of degrees) should be stored in transform component.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>If you're wondering where the individual <b>polygons</b> will be stored that depends on you. Maybe you will
			want it in polygon collider component(I prefer it this way) or maybe in shape component which could be used
			for both collision and drawing the polygon, you have to decide for your self.</p>
		<h1>Center of mass</h1>
		<p>
			To calculate <b>center of mass</b> we will simply get <b>average</b> of all the vertices in polygon. If you
			want you can give the vertices weight... To do this you will keep a vector, let's call it
			<b>averageVector</b>.
			You will <b>loop through all the vertices</b> and add their position multiplied by their <b>weight</b> to
			the averageVector. After the loop is done you will <b>divide</b> the averageVector by the <b>number of
				vertices</b> in polygon.
		</p>

		<h1>Moment of inertia and mass</h1>
		<p>
			In order to calculate <b>mass</b> you need to find the <b>area of polygon</b> and multiply it by
			<b>density</b>. To calculate <b>moment of inertia</b> of a polygon you will need to copy this code, because
			I could't get it working my own way, this way seems just fine:
		</p>
		<img src="images/compute-force.png" alt="" class="small roundcorners center">

		<h1>Rotation</h1>
		<img src="images/gridrot.png" alt="" class="small floatR roundcorners">
		<p>
			Each frame we will have to calculate <b>rotated vertices</b>, once at start for collider and once in the end
			for displaying the result. Now how to rotate the vertices? First of all we need to have a list of
			<b>vertices</b> that are just vectors offset from position,
			that should be the <b>middle/center of mass of the body</b>(the point where all the vertices will be rotated
			around). Also we will have to keep the rotated values in <b>another array</b>, because we can't overwrite
			the vertices array(we will use it every frame).
			So we will <b>loop</b> through all vertices and we will save the results in an array, the <b>equation for
				calculating rotated vertex</b> is as follows:
		</p>
		<p style="color:red;font-weight:600">REMEMBER: angle has to always be in radians</p>
		<p style="text-align:center"><b>NewX = X * cos(angle) - Y * sin(angle)</b></p>
		<p style="text-align:center"><b>NewY = Y * cos(angle) + X * sin(angle)</b></p>
		<p>If you already want to add the position to it so that you won't have to loop through them again you simply do
			this:</p>
		<p style="text-align:center"><b>NewX = NewX + Position.X</b></p>
		<p style="text-align:center"><b>NewY = NewY + Position.Y</b></p>

		<br>
		<h1>Summary</h1>
		<p>This should give you enough information to calculate some of the most important values in order to create
			your own oriented rigid body physics. In the next blog I will tlk about forces and velocities.
			<!--<h1><a id="euler"> Numerical Integration</a></h1>
	<p>
		Also called differential equation solver, in nutshell it servers to change velocity and position in some order...
		<br>The most popular one is called <b>Explicit euler</b> which looks like this:
		<p style="text-align:center"><b>CurrentVelocity = LastFrameVelocity + (LastFrameAcceleration * dt)</b></p>
		<p style="text-align:center"><b>CurrentPosition = LastFramePosition + (LastFrameVelocity * dt)</b></p>
		<p>Although it's not the most acurrate it is very simple to implement.

		<br>Next one is <b>Implicit euler</b> which looks like this:
		<br>
		<p style="text-align:center"><b>CurrentVelocity = LastFrameVelocity + (CurrentAcceleration * dt)</b></p>
		<p style="text-align:center"><b>CurrentPosition = LastFramePosition + (CurrentVelocity * dt)</b></p>
		<p>This is the most stable one, that's why I use it

		<br>There is also <b>Semi-Implicit euler</b> which looks like this:
		<p style="text-align:center"><b>CurrentVelocity = LastFrameVelocity + (LastFrameAcceleration * dt)</b></p>
		<p style="text-align:center"><b>CurrentPosition = LastFramePosition + (CurrentVelocity * dt)</b></p>
		<p>This provides a middle ground between the two</p>
		<br>
		<p>There also other Numerical Integrations like Runge Kutta 4th Order but I don't use them...
