			  <h1>Why?</h1>
			  <div>
				  First, I want to talk about why I decided to make a website. I started thinking about making a website when I needed a place for a <b>portfolio</b> and to keep my games and projects together.
				  I thought <b>itch.io</b> would be enough, but unfortunately, I wanted a completely different page for blogs and devlogs, which itch.io doesn't yet have. I also wanted to practice <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>.
			  </div>
			  <h1>Starting point</h1>
			  <div>
				  I started by searching for website builders like <b>Wix</b> and <b>Monokeep</b>, but they weren't free. I messaged my friend and co-worker Dan, who has already made his website. He said that I should check out HTML templates.
				  When I was searching for a <b>template</b>, I found a really great website called templated.co where I found a template with the name HIELO. This was my starting point for making this website.
			  </div>
			  <h1>Main development</h1>
			  <div>
				  In this stage, I started with the <b>index (home page)</b>. I changed some graphics, created some links, rewrote some paragraphs, changed my social media, and drew some art.
				  It wasn't that hard, but organizing and realizing how it works was a bit tough. After that, I created a few new pages: <b>About, Blogs, and Game Engine</b>.
				  I also made <b>Blog0</b>, which is this blog you're reading right now. I skipped the <b>About</b> page because the About page is basically about my career, and it is just text.
				  On the Game Engine page, I created a banner and some titles; I didn't do anything else because again, it would probably be just text and maybe a few links. I moved to probably the most <b>complex</b> one,
				  and that was the <b>blogs</b> page.
				 

			  </div>
			  <h1>Blogs</h1>
			  <div>
				  First, I made the banner, and then I copied the grid layout from the index and put it in blogs. I created my first blog called, as you guessed it, "How I Made My Website".
				  I found some free-to-use website images, edited them a bit, and then used them. I found out that at one resolution,
				  the headline of the page ("How I Made My Website") is glitching when the resolution is too low. To fix it, I had to change the font size in CSS. In detail,
				  I had to change the units from em to vw so that it dynamically scaled. That seemed to work. This is most of the work, the only thing left is the text...
