		<h1>
			Career
		</h1>
		<h2>
			2017
		</h2>
		<p>
			I started programming in C++. I was playing games a lot and I wondered how are they made. That idea brought me to C++. I used borrowed laptop for it, it wasn't anything fast but it did the job.
			I learned some basics like variables, functions, struct, classes... I made few projects in console like crossy road, snake or tetris.
		</p>
		<h2>
			2018
		</h2>
		<p>
			In 2018 I started thinking more about game development rather than programming. I learned that there are so called "Game engines" that make creating games easier and fast.
			I tried to use Unreal Engine, because only language I knew was C++. However unfortunately the performance was really bad, so in summer I got new laptop. I downloaded Unreal Engine 4.
			I started learning some basics but after a while I started realizing that 3D games may be too tough to handle...
		</p>
		<h2>
			2019
		</h2>
		<p>
			I continued with Unreal Engine but after a while I decided to switch to Unity, because I wanted to do 2D games. I learnt C# pretty quickly, after all it's all object oriented programming.
			With unity I felt confident so after 2 months, I decided to make a quick game. I didn't publish it anywhere yet because I didn't have any idea where.
		</p>
		<h2>
			2020
		</h2>
		<p>
			In this year I didn't do much just few projects...
		</p>
		<h2>
			2021
		</h2>
		<p>
			My itch.io page was made and I made my discord community. I released the game from 2019 and I call it <a href="https://f1shs0up.itch.io/gravbeta" class="new-color-link">Grav</a>. I started working more and more and after few failed projects,
			I thought of making mobile game. After almost half a year of work I published it on google play (unfortunately my acount got blocked) and I called it <a href="https://f1shs0up.itch.io/dunk-it" class="new-color-link">Dunk IT!</a>
		</p>
		<h2>
			2022
		</h2>
		<img src="images/mehtris.png" alt="" class="image-round image extra small no mobile floatR">
		<p>
			In the first half I participated in my first game jam. It was called Black And White Jam. I finished 46th out of 341 entries. It wasn't the best result but it was atleast something.
			The game was called <a href="https://f1shs0up.itch.io/mehtris" class="new-color-link">Mehtris</a>. I got bored of Unity but back then I liked C# more so I got the idea of using framework.
			At that time I played stardew valley a lot so I decided to make a game in Monogame(XNA). I liked it a lot, therefore I participated in another Game Jam called The GameDev.tv Game Jam.
			I made game called <a href="https://f1shs0up.itch.io/suffering" class="new-color-link">Suffering</a> and it ended up finishing 88th out of 933 entries. Again nothing to be really happy about but it wasn't that bad result.
			In the second half I thought of making a bigger game but it didn't work out well.
		</p>
		<h2>
			2023
		</h2>
		<img src="images/cottage.gif" alt="" class="image-round image extra small no mobile floatR">
		<p>
			I joined Team Melon and we did one game jam together. We ended up placing 3rd which was an awesome result. Even tho I am a programmer I was the main artist for this game.
			The game is called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318780/CottageVille/" class="new-color-link">Cottage ville</a>. We continued to develop this game end we ended up putting it on steam half a year later.
			We also did monkey jam where we finished 11th. We called the game for monkey jam <a href="https://danqzq.itch.io/esc-ape" class="new-color-link">ESC-Ape</a>.
			This year I was also working on a game for an art competition, that has been hosted in my contry. We finished 3rd which absolutely blew my mind, because the competition is known across whole Czechia.
			The game I am talking about is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318780/CottageVille/" class="new-color-link">Fairtrade Ride</a>. 
			After that I started working on my <a href="engine.html" class="new-color-link">Game Engine</a>.
