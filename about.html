		<h1>
			Career
		</h1>
		<h2>
			2017
		</h2>
		<p>
			I started programming in <b>C++</b>. I was playing games a lot and I wondered <b>how are they made</b>. That
			idea brought me to C++. I used borrowed laptop for it, it wasn't anything fast but it did the job.
			I learned some basics like <b>variables, functions, struct, classes</b>... I made few projects in console
			like <b>crossy road, snake or tetris</b>.
		</p>
		<h2>
			2018
		</h2>
		<p>
			In 2018 I started thinking more about <b>game development</b> rather than programming. I learned that there
			are so called <b>"Game engines"</b> that make creating games easier and fast.
			I tried to use <b>Unreal Engine</b>, because only language I knew was C++. However unfortunately the
			performance was really bad, so in summer I got new laptop. I downloaded <b>Unreal Engine 4</b>.
			I started learning some basics but after a while I started realizing that 3D games may be too tough to
			handle...
		</p>
		<h2>
			2019
		</h2>
		<p>
			I continued with <b>Unreal Engine</b> but after a while I decided to switch to Unity, because I wanted to do
			2D games. I learned C# pretty quickly, after all it's all object oriented programming.
			With unity I felt <b>confident</b> so after 2 months, I decided to make a <b>quick game</b>. I didn't
			publish it anywhere yet because I didn't have any idea where.
		</p>
		<h2>
			2020
		</h2>
		<p>
			In this year I didn't do much just few projects...
		</p>
		<h2>
			2021
		</h2>
		<p>
			My <a href="https://f1shs0up.itch.io" class="new-color-link">itch.io</a> page was made and I made my <a
				href="https://discord.gg/Fn2befK8Gq" class="new-color-link">discord community</a>.
			I released the game from 2019 and I call it <a href="https://f1shs0up.itch.io/gravbeta"
				class="new-color-link">Grav</a>. I started working <b>more and more</b> and after few failed projects,
			I thought of making <b>mobile game</b>. After almost half a year of work I published it on <b>google
				play</b> (unfortunately my acount got blocked) and I called it <a
				href="https://f1shs0up.itch.io/dunk-it" class="new-color-link">Dunk IT!</a>
		</p>
		<h2>
			2022
		</h2>
		<img src="images/mehtris.png" alt="" class="roundcorners extra-small-no-mobile floatR">
		<p>
			In the first half I participated in my first <b>game jam</b>. It was called <b>Black And White Jam</b>. I
			finished <b>46th</b> out of 341 entries. It wasn't the best result but it was atleast something.
			The game was called <a href="https://f1shs0up.itch.io/mehtris" class="new-color-link">Mehtris</a>. I got
			<b>bored</b> of Unity but back then I liked C# more so I got the idea of using <b>framework</b>.
			At that time I played stardew valley a lot so I decided to make a game in <b>Monogame(XNA)</b>. I liked it a
			lot, therefore I participated in another Game Jam called <b>The GameDev.tv Game Jam</b>.
			I made game called <a href="https://f1shs0up.itch.io/suffering" class="new-color-link">Suffering</a> and it
			ended up finishing <b>88th</b> out of 933 entries. Again nothing to be really happy about but it wasn't that
			bad result.
			In the second half I thought of making a <b>bigger game</b> but it didn't work out well.
		</p>
		<h2>
			2023
		</h2>
		<img src="images/cottage.gif" alt="" class="roundcorners extra-small-no-mobile floatR">
		<p>
			I joined <b>Team Melon</b> and we did one <b>game jam</b> together. We ended up placing <b>3rd</b> which was
			an awesome result. Even tho I am a programmer I was the main <b>artist</b> for this game.
			The game is called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318780/CottageVille/"
				class="new-color-link">Cottage ville</a>. We continued to develop this game and we ended up putting it
			on <b>steam</b> half a year later.
			We also did <b>monkey jam</b> where we finished <b>11th</b>. We called the game for monkey jam <a
				href="https://danqzq.itch.io/esc-ape" class="new-color-link">ESC-Ape</a>.
			This year I was also working on a game for an <b>art competition</b>, that has been hosted in my country. We
			finished <b>3rd</b>, which absolutely blew my mind, because the competition is <b>known</b> across whole
			Czechia.
			The game I am talking about is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2318780/CottageVille/"
				class="new-color-link">Fairtrade Ride</a>. I got a <b>part time job</b>, where I saved enough money to
			get a really decent computer.
			After that I started working on my <a href="2dengine.html" class="new-color-link">2D Game Engine</a>.
