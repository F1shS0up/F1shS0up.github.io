		<h1>What was the problem?</h1>
		<p>
			My engine works on the principle of statit library. I simply build the engine as a library and I include this library in my game project.
			The issue I was facing was, that I needed some way to make some custom game classes that I would implement in game project instead of implementing it in engine project.
		</p>
		<h1>1st idea</h1>
		<p>
			I first thought of simply creating an independent game system that would initiate the engines functions. Problem with this is that sometimes we want to initiate functions from the engine.
			As an example, let's say we have a collider component implemented in engine.
			When collider leaves collision we want to initiate a function in character movement, a component implemented in game project, that's going to disallow the player to move the character.
			With this system it coudn't be done, or it could but there is easier ways.
		</p>
		<h1>2nd idea</h1>
		<img src="images/gameToEngine-blog1.png" alt="" class="image-round image small floatR">
		<p>
			I wanted to keep the idea of game system in game project. I realized there is better way to do it, by overriding engines main classes, some of them will be controlled through game some of them will be through engine.
			Thanks to this I can control functions like Render, Update or Init from game and functions like when collision happens from engine.
			Also thanks to overriding, I can acquire the data of each entity, such as components which I can use in game project...
